# Find more answers

If you're looking for an answer, the community is the best place to get some help very quickly. My first choice is always the [JuliaLang Forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/). If that doesn't work, the [Julia Language Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) is next door. But the docs are also ok, if you're either certain or desperate to find your answer there. There is also [this great video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVmU29rCjaA) that helped me get started developing packages in Julia.
