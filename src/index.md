# Overview

This tutorial is meant to walk you through the package development workflow in Julia. I will base my explanations on my own experience building [FdeSolver.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/FdeSolver.jl) and [MicrobiomeAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/MicrobiomeAnalysis.jl) as well as valuable resources by others that I came across online.
